# This is the solution of the program Reverse Integer of LeetCode.
# We have used OOP's Python Here

# class Solution:
#     def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
#         rev = 0
#         while(x > 0):
#             remainder = x % 10
#             rev = rev * 10 + remainder
#             x = x // 10
#         return rev


# A = Solution()
# print(A.reverse(765))

# The Above Solution if for the input(positive integers)
