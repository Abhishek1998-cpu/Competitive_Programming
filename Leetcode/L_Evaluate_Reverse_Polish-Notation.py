# Important Question of Stack
# Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
# Stack
# Reverse Polish Notation = Postfix Notation

# Approach:
# Accessing all elements in the array, if the element is not matching with the special character (‘+’, ‘-‘,’*’, ‘/’) then push the element to the stack.

# Then whenever the special character is found then pop the first two-element from the stack and perform the action and then push the element (resultant element) to stack again.

# Repeat the above two process to all elements in the array

# At last pop the element from the stack and print the Result
